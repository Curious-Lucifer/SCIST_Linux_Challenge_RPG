Task Prompt : DaZhuang said that the treasure map of "People's Law Gavel ðŸ”¨" is divided into three parts. The first part is in the desert under our home directory.

Side Quest : Treasure Hunter's Training (challenge is in `~/Treasure_Hunters_Training/`) 
1. strings : To accurately locate treasure, treasure hunters need good eyesight.
2. strings & grep : But the accuracy of our eyes are still not enough, we need to use tools.
3. strings & grep & regex 1 : More efficient ...
4. strings & grep & regex 2 : Wait! What?!
5. xargs : When treasure hunters hunt for treasure, in addition to locating the treasure, they must also pay attention to whether the surrounding environment is dangerous. So treasure hunters need to multitask. Your target is finding the right `target`.
